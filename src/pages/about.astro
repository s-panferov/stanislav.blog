	<p>
		Hello! I'm <strong>Stanislav Panferov</strong>, a passionate software engineering leader based in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
		With a Master's degree and deep expertise in system programming and web technologies, I love helping teams build 
		innovative software that pushes the boundaries of what's possible.
	</p>

	<h2>Current Role</h2>
	<p>
		I'm currently working at <strong>Snowflake</strong> as a Staff Software Engineer, where I focus on developer tools, 
		Bazel integration, and UI platform development. My work involves improving developer productivity and building 
		robust infrastructure that powers Snowflake's engineering ecosystem.
	</p>

	<h2>Professional Journey</h2>
	
	<h3>Figma (Jan 2023 - Present)</h3>
	<p>
		At Figma, I worked as a Staff Software Engineer on performance optimization using WebAssembly. I led initiatives 
		including developing a C++/WASM DWARF debugging system, implementing client-side error symbolication, and creating 
		memory observability tools. I also provided technical leadership and mentorship to junior team members.
	</p>

	<h3>Meta (Sep 2020 - Dec 2022)</h3>
	<p>
		As a Software Engineer at Meta, I worked on bringing the web platform to AR/VR space through the Oculus Browser 
		(Chromium-based). I also contributed to developing a high-performance IPC/RPC solution for microkernel OS, 
		including IDL language design and Rust-based compiler development. Additionally, I worked on next-generation 
		language design for AR/VR devices with LLVM IR generation.
	</p>

	<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
	
	<h3>Languages</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Primary:</strong> TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, C/C++, Go<br/>
		<strong>Additional:</strong> SQL, WebAssembly, and various domain-specific languages
	</p>

	<h3>Specializations</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Web Technologies:</strong> React, Node.js, State Management, Performance Optimization, GraphQL</li>
		<li><strong>System Programming:</strong> Distributed Systems, WebAssembly, IPC/RPC, AR/VR domains</li>
		<li><strong>DevOps & Tools:</strong> Kubernetes, Docker, Bazel build systems</li>
		<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Technical leadership, hiring, mentorship, and team building</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What Drives Me</h2>
	<p>
		I'm passionate about performance optimization, developer experience, and building tools that make complex 
		systems more accessible. Whether it's modularizing a TypeScript/C++/WASM codebase, designing compiler 
		infrastructure, or mentoring engineers, I thrive on technical challenges that have real impact.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technology trends, contributing to open-source projects, 
		or spending quality time with my kids.
	</p>
